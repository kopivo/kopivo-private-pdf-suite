## 🚫 The Problem with Cloud PDF Tools
Legacy editors like iLovePDF, SmallPDF, and Adobe Online rely on an outdated "Upload-Process-Download" model. This creates critical vulnerabilities:
1. **Privacy Breaches:** Your sensitive data (contracts, IDs, financial records) is stored on third-party servers.
2. **Data Latency:** High-resolution PDFs take significant time to upload and re-download.
3. **Monetization Barriers:** Most platforms use server costs as an excuse to force users into expensive subscriptions.

**Kopivo eliminates the server, eliminating the risk.**

## ⚙️ How Kopivo Works (WASM Tech)
Kopivo utilizes **WebAssembly**, a low-level binary instruction format that executes C++ and Rust-based PDF engines at near-native speed inside the browser's sandbox.

- **Edge Computing:** Your device (PC, Tablet, or Smartphone) provides the CPU power.
- **Data Sovereignty:** Documents never leave your RAM. Only static assets (HTML/JS/WASM) are delivered by our CDN.
- **Zero-Footprint:** Once the tab is closed, all traces of the document are automatically wiped from the device's volatile memory.

## 🛡️ Privacy & Security Protocol
Kopivo operates on a **No-Log, No-Cloud** mandate:
1. **Local Intake:** Files are accessed via the browser's File API.
2. **In-Memory Processing:** The WASM module performs transformations in a secure, isolated sandbox.
3. **Instant Output:** The browser triggers a local Blob download. **No data is ever sent to a backend.**

## 🚀 Future Vision (Roadmap)
- [ ] **Local AI-OCR:** Optical Character Recognition using Tesseract.js to extract text from scanned documents without cloud APIs.
- [ ] **Smart Redaction:** Automated detection and blurring of sensitive data (PII) using local machine learning.
